VBD
===

:class:`~newton.solvers.SolverVBD` is a unified implicit solver based on
Vertex Block Descent (VBD): cloth, soft bodies, rigid bodies (joints,
contacts, rods), and their interactions are all solved in one VBD loop, with
joint and contact constraints enforced through an augmented-Lagrangian (ALM)
extension of the method. Enable the ALM constraint path with
``rigid_compliant_alm=True`` (recommended); omitting the option currently
retains the deprecated legacy path during the migration period.

.. experimental::

   :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverVBD` is experimental. Its public API,
   behavior, feature support, performance, and implementation may change
   without prior notice.

This page is the VBD backend guide: when to choose the solver, how to set it
up correctly, and where to find runnable examples. For symptom-driven
diagnosis and parameter tuning, see :ref:`Tuning VBD` and the
:ref:`Simulation Tuning` landing page.

.. note::

   This guide is under active development. Each section below states its
   intended scope and links to existing references until the full content
   lands.

When to Choose VBD
------------------

*In development.* This section will position VBD against the other Newton
solvers for cloth, soft-body, rigid, and mixed scenes, and state its current
limitations.

Until then, start from the :ref:`Supported Features` matrix and the
:ref:`Joint feature support` tables in the :doc:`solver overview
</solvers/index>`. The underlying methods are described in the references
cited by :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverVBD`:

  Descent. *ACM Trans. Graph.* 43, 4. https://doi.org/10.1145/3658179
- Chris Giles, Elie Diaz, and Cem Yuksel. 2025. Augmented Vertex Block
  Descent. *ACM Trans. Graph.* 44, 4. https://doi.org/10.1145/3731195
  (the deprecated legacy rigid constraint path)

API Explanations
----------------

Construction and Stepping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*In development.* This section will cover the canonical setup and step loop:
coloring via :meth:`~newton.ModelBuilder.color` (required for particles and
for rigid bodies integrated by VBD), the recommended
``CollisionPipeline`` → ``Contacts`` → ``SolverVBD`` construction order, and
the CUDA graph capture constraints around contact state pre-allocation.

Until then, see the :class:`~newton.solvers.SolverVBD` API reference, which
documents the constructor and includes a minimal working simulation loop.

Model Inputs
~~~~~~~~~~~~

*In development.* This section will explain what the solver consumes from
:class:`~newton.ModelBuilder` for each system: triangle meshes for cloth,
tetrahedral meshes for soft bodies, rigid bodies with the supported joint
types (including rods), the ALM constraint mode (``rigid_compliant_alm=True``,
recommended) versus the deprecated legacy path, and the deprecated legacy-path
controls — ``model.vbd.joint_is_hard`` and
:meth:`~newton.solvers.SolverVBD.set_joint_constraint_mode` (deprecated since
1.6; no solver-mode effect under compliant ALM).

Coupling Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*In development.* This section will cover how deformables and rigid bodies
interact inside the solver (no special coupling setup is needed) and one-way
coupling with an external rigid-body solver
(``integrate_with_external_rigid_solver=True``).

Until then, see :doc:`Coupled Solvers </concepts/coupling>`.

Contact Handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*In development.* This section will explain the contact stack: particle
self-contact detection (vertex–triangle and edge–edge), body–particle
contacts, friction, and the penetration-free Divide and Truncate (DAT)
scheme that truncates particle motion against contact bounds. Coverage of
Offset Geometric Contact (OGC) will be added once it is available in
Newton.

The contact methods are described in:

  and Truncate: A Penetration and Inversion Free Framework for Coupled
  Multi-physics System. In *ACM SIGGRAPH 2026 Conference Papers*.

  Yuksel. 2025. Offset Geometric Contact. *ACM Trans. Graph.* 44, 4.
  https://doi.org/10.1145/3731205

Key Constructor Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*In development.* A lean orientation over the three constructor parameter
groups — common, ``particle_*``, and ``rigid_*`` — cross-linked to
:class:`~newton.solvers.SolverVBD` for defaults and to :ref:`Tuning VBD` for
effects and recommended values.

Examples
--------

*In development.* This section will walk through a small, representative set
of examples per system rather than the full list.
