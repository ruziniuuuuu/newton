# FROZEN — do not modify.
#
# This package is the raytracer backing the deprecated ``SensorTiledCamera``.
# It is kept only to support that class through its deprecation window and is
# scheduled for removal alongside it. Do not change anything in this directory:
# it is intentionally not kept in sync with the active renderer, and a guard
# test (``newton/tests/test_frozen_tiled_renderer.py``) fails on any edit here.
#
# All new rendering work belongs in ``newton/_src/sensors/sensor_camera_render``
# (the renderer behind ``newton.sensors.SensorCamera``).
